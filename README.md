This small project using the Quasar Framework will tell and show a little about me.
Here you can see the statistics of my profile on GitHub, the statistics of solving problems on LeetCode and on CodeWars.
All data is obtained using various APIs and, accordingly, is updated in real time.
This project is made in order to send a link to HH's so that they can study my stack and code.
